    <p>
        In 2015, Adobe debuted <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/captivateprime.html" target="_blank">Adobe
            Captivate Prime</a>, a new learning management system
        (LMS).
        As the Design Lead on the product team, I was accountable for product UX for several releases, including the 1.0
        launch.</p>
        <p>In 2022, the product was rechristened as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/captivateprime.html" target="_blank">Adobe Learning Manager</a>.</p>
    <p>
        A LMS is, typically, a corporate learning solution that helps organizations train, develop, and engage their
        employees. Such solutions also include administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and automation of
        learning
        goals.
    </p>
    
    <h3>My role in the team</h3>
    <p>
        As the primary Experience Designer (and the only one for majority of my tenure), I was accountable for
        delivering the product experience across web, mobile, and tablets. I joined the team in late 2014 and was part
        of the 1.0 release, and subsequent feature enhancements, upgrades, release events, and customer interactions,
        until May 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being part of a small product team that incubated the product, my work involved design strategy, design
        research, drawing the UI, copywriting, bug resolution, and everything in between. I collaborated with
        Leadership, and worked in close proximity with product management and engineering teams to define features and
        lead
        all aspects of user experience.

    <h3>Product experience</h3>
    <p>We built a product from ground up. Starting from scratch gave us the opportunity to better understand the market,
        the user needs & motivations, identify gaps in existing products, and focus on what really matters for our
        users. </p>
    <p>Adobe has been a leader in producing e-learning authoring tools since 2005, and the team had the necessary
        knowledge and expertise to build something radical. </p>
    <p>During my 3+ years at Adobe, the product was widely adopted and the feature-set grew rapidly in all possible
        directions an enterprise software could grow. </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img_portfolio/adbe/learner_home.jpg" alt="Screens showing learner dashboard" />
        <figcaption>Early concept of the Learner home, showing Home and Course catalog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Below are some key product areas that we focussed on
        (and that I am proud of.)</p>
    <h4>Building a modern experience</h4>
    <p>
        Fundamentally, we believed that users of enterprise software deserved a modern UX, as simple & cool as any other
        consumer product they use outside work. One of the design principles, to achieve this, was to strive for simple
        workflows.</p>
    <p>
        Our key finding from existing products was that they had long-winding forms for content creation. We addressed
        this by carefully auditing legacy processes and
        minimizing them to just the right amount of details. This ensured that jobs
        in the system took as less time as possible.

        We used a pastel color palette, modern iconography, and dynamic illustrations, to bring a fresh perspective to
        enterprise software.
    </p>
    <p>The product, design, and engineering teams collaborated to build this 'modern'-ness and 'simplicity' into the
        product.</p>
    <h4>Hassle-free content consumption experience</h4>
    <p>We built a 'fluidic player' that could take in and play any kind of learning content (simple
        videos to advanced SCORM-based), without the overhead to install browser plugins or additional software. Besides
        playing content, the user can take notes, switch between lessons, control speed, change language,
        and much more, all from within the player. Imagine the Netflix movie player, but for learning content and back
        in 2014. </p>
    <p>The tech behind the player enables admins to track learner progress, embed quizzes, and
        flexibility for viewing content (whether to do a course in a single go or with breaks).</p>

            alt="Player with learning content in action, showing module list and an overlay control." />
        <figcaption>The 'fluidic' content player, that can play any type of learning content.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h4>Easy onboarding to the product</h4>
    <p>
        Migrating to new enterprise software is a gargantuan task, and learning departments never take chances with new
        software or risk downtime. One of the first features the team cracked was to combine tech innovation
        with a simple UX, so that anyone could buy Captivate Prime, deploy it, and start rolling
        out courses in as less as 90-minutes. Yes! 90-minutes. </p>
    <p>This USP contributed to easy adoption and rapid growth in the early days.
    </p>

    <h4> Gamification to make learning fun & engaging</h4>
    <p>
        We wanted learning to be fun and an involved process. So, we used gamification
        techniques to reward learners on parameters such as early completion, learning
        consistency, upskilling, and completion volume, amongst other behaviour. A leaderboard shows how
        learners fare over time and even receive shareable <a href="https://openbadges.org/" target="_blank">Open
            Badges</a>, to brag achievements on Linkedin.
    </p>

    <h4>Social Learning</h4>
    <p>
        Social media is a powerful tool to influence user behaviour. The team worked on bringing these
        engagement principles
        to supplement traditional learning methods. The social learning platform in the product enables users to
        informally share ideas and meaningful insights. Learning activity by users in the system is used to encourage
        others to
        learn and upskill. </p>
    <p>Users can share learning content internally, have discussions
        about a course, build communities, promote content, and even help each other on new topics.
        Users receive karma points (sorta) for active learning and for influencing the system
        activity.
    </p>

            alt="Concept of a user profile page showing user data and other social information." />
        <figcaption>Social learning concept screens to encourage collaborative learning</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h4>Skill-centric Learning</h4>
    <p>
        Corporate learning is always 'mandatory'. Users rarely do proactive learning. To make
        learning an engaged activity, we centered the UI and the copy around skills. Each
        learning entity focused on skills and sub-skills; search is pivoted around skills to enable
        easy discovery. Users can explore skills at their career level or peer-skills to know trends
        in the company. Skill explorers and maps help learners discover new skills to level
        themselves up and to align with organizational expectations. </p>
    <p>This product feature helped admins drive a lot of new learning content in
        their organizations. In the long run, this contributed to user retention.
