            <h3>Travel to Mumbai</h3>
            <section>
              <p>The venue of the conference is located in the city of Mumbai situated on the western coast of India, in the state of Maharashtra.</p>
               <p>The Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (BOM) in Mumbai is India's second busiest airport and is connected by direct flights to most of the major airports in the world. In case of non-availability of direct flights, delegates may take hopping flights via other major airports in India like New Delhi (DEL), Chennai (MAA), Kolkata (CCU), Hyderabad (HYD) and Bangalore (BLR). Mumbai has frequent and daily flights connecting several locations within India.</p>
               <p>The Mumbai airport is about 9.1km/5.6miles from IIT Bombay in Powai, which is the venue of the conference. Details of the accommodation options available near the venue can be viewed on the <a href="acco">Accommodations page</a>.</p>

      		<h3>Commuting in Mumbai</h3>
            <section>
              <p>For delegates and participants who are new to India and Mumbai, we highly recommend that you use cab services like Uber or Ola Cabs for commuting in Mumbai. These services have a strong network in the city and operate throughout the day.</p>
              <p>We also suggest that you get all the necessary information from any of our team members if you wish to visit places around the city. Options like the Mumbai Local (the train network), Mumbai Bus and the Mumbai Taxi are very fascinating but you will need local assistance to travel on one of these if you are new to the city.</p>
               <p>The VMCC Auditorium where the conference will be held is about 1.2km/0.75miles from the entrance of the IIT Bombay campus. Residents on the campus usually walk or use the internal commute service. We will, however, upload details of commute to and from the venue as we get closer to the conference. <a href="venue">Know more about the venue.</a></p>
