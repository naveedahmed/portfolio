                            <p>Installations are interesting interactive displays or setups that are especially created for the conference. An installation may provide a function, or it may be an aesthetic piece of art. An installation may directly relate to the theme, venue, conference programme, speakers, and/or participants of the conference.</p>
                            <p>It may use interactive technologies in an interesting way or it may promote interaction amongst the participants. It may “inform” the passers by near the convention venue about what is going on in the conference. Or it may be completely different from any of these, and may be a total surprise.</p>
                            <p>Student and industry groups are encouraged to put up an installation showcasing their talent.</p>
