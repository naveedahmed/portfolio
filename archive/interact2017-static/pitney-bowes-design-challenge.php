                <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
<p>Many cities around the world have incorporated a bike rental service to make it easier (and greener) for locals and (or) tourists to get around town. Riders can pick up a bike from one location in the city, and drop it off in another.
</p>
<p>			Mumbai is planning to implement a bike rental service that will allow people to easily navigate the city. Your task is to create a digital solution to locate, reserve, pick up, return, and keep track of the bikes.
