				<h3>Amplifying Human Abilities: Digital Technologies to Enhance Perception and Cognition</h3>

<p>		Historically, the use and development of tools is strongly linked to human evolution and intelligence. The last 10.000 years show a stunning progress in physical tools that have transformed what people can do and how people live. Currently, we are at the beginning of an even more fundamental transformation: the use of digital tools to amplify the mind. 
</p>		
<p>		Digital technologies provide us with entirely new opportunities to enhance the perceptual and cognitive abilities of humans. Many ideas, ranging from mobile access to search engines, to wearable devices for lifelogging and augmented realty application give as first indications of this transition. 
</p>		
<p>		In our research we create novel digital technologies that systematically explore how to enhance human cognition and perception. Our experimental approach is to: first, understand the users in their context as well as the potential for enhancement. Second, we create innovative interventions that provide functionality that amplifies human capabilities. And third, we empirically evaluate and quantify the enhancement that is gained by these developments. 
</p>		
<p>		It is exciting to see how ultimately these new ubiquitous computing technologies have the potential for overcoming fundamental limitations in human perception and cognition. 
</p>

				<h3>Weaving new Mobile UX futures through integrated innovation across 3 Continents, 4 Countries and a diversity of perspectives</h3>
			<div class="info yellow">Andy Cockburn was originally scheduled to give the closing keynote at INTERACT 2017. Unfortunately, Andy has had an accident - he injured his neck while trying to teach his kids how to backflip on a trampoline! He cannot fly to India (he's OK and we wish him a speedy recovery). Our closing keynote will now be given by Matt Jones - as you'll see from his abstract, Matt is often travelling the world and is a regular visitor to Mumbai. We're delighted that he is able to join us for the conference. (<a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#andy-details">Read about Andy's now-cancelled talk</a>)</div>
<p>Mobile and ubiquitous computing researchers have long imagined future worlds for users in developed regions. Steered by such visions, they have innovated devices and services exploring the value of these with and for individuals, groups and communities. Meanwhile, such radical and long-term explorations are uncommon for what have been termed emergent users; users, that is, for whom advanced technologies are just within grasp. Instead, a driving assumption is, perhaps, that today’s high-end mobile technologies will "trickle down" to these user groups in due course. 
</p>
<p>For the past three years, our team of researchers and partner organisations have started to explore how to do future envisioning that includes emergent communities. We have carried out intensive, coordinated innovation-prototyping-deploym ent yearly cycles that has seen us work with people from townships in South Africa and informal and slum districts in India and Kenya.  These activities have seen the development of a number of novel mobile devices and services that would not have emerged without the insights provided and integrated across these regions.
</p>
<p>In this talk,  I will explore what mobile technologies might be like if emergent users are directly involved in creating their visions for the future 5–10 years from now; explain and reflect on our methods, highlighting the success and failures; detail some of the platforms and devices we've created; and, argue that such innovation is also vital to re-invigorate mobile design for the "traditional users" (like me) in the rest of the world. 
</p>		


<h4>Speaker Bio</h4>

<p>				Matt Jones is the author of two books and many research articles that have helped shape the field of Mobile HCI and UX (Mobile Interaction Design - with Gary Marsden; and There's Not an App for That - with Simon Robinson and Gary Marsden). 
</p>
<p>He has spoken at events with both an arts focus (such as the Hay Book Festiva 2017l) and the sciences (such as this the British Science Festival 2016). He has worked both with academic research groups and industrial partners across the world. His work combines a passion for invention with a commitment to working alongside non-traditional users of mobile technology. 
</p>
<p>He is a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award Holder (for his work on interactions for resource constrained communities); was awarded an IBM Faculty Award (for work with the Spoken Web); and leads two major UK programmes focussed on human values and computational science (the Research Council UK funded Digital Economy CHERISH Centre; and the Welsh Government/ EU funded Computational Foundry). He has enjoyed being part of the HCI community: he co-chaired ACM CHI 2014; ACM Mobile HCI 2017; and is on the steering committee of both of these conference series. <a href="http://www.undofuture.com" target="_blank">More here.</a>

				<h3>Faster, More Learnable, and Preferred: Experiences Using Applied Psychology to Engineer Interactions</h3>
			
<p>				Research and practice in Human-Computer Interaction has come a long way in the thirty-four years since Card, Moran and Newell published their seminal book 'The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction'. However, the central tenet of their book remains every bit as relevant today as it was in 1983 -- the design of user interfaces can and should be informed by engineering methods that are based on understanding from applied psychology.
</p>
<p>This talk will review several research projects that I have conducted with my students and colleagues, which aim to improve interaction by applying human factors lessons from psychology. The review is structured around four broad categories of human factors: motor coordination, spatial memory, skill acquisition, and biases in subjective experience. 
</p>
<p>Within these categories I will describe interfaces and experiments that demonstrate how interaction can be positively (and negatively) influenced by the factors, across interactive tasks including scrolling, command invocation, text messaging, file navigation, and the experience of assistive interfaces.
</p>
<p>A key objective of the talk is to demonstrate, through examples, that lessons from applied psychology can (and should) be used to improve performance and experience with interactive systems.
</p>
		<h4>Speaker Bio</h4>
<p>		Andy Cockburn is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he directs the Human Computer Interaction Lab.
</p>
<p>Andy's research focuses on designing, evaluating and modelling user interfaces, with a focus on understanding and exploiting specific underlying human factors. His contributions include many interface designs that use human spatial memory to support expertise development in basic tasks such as file retrieval, command invocation, window switching, and scrolling.
</p>
<p>Dr. Cockburn serves on the Editorial Boards of ACM ToCHI, the Human-Computer Interaction Journal, and Foundations and Trends in Human-Computer Interaction. He was papers co-chair for CHI 2014 and 2015. In 2015 he was inducted to the CHI Academy.

				<h3>Understanding Consumer India and
what businesses need to do to serve them better
</h3>
<p>				People who address Consumer India or People India and develop products for them need to get away from traditional / offer wrong mental models of what emerging market consumers are like or what poor people and uneducated people are like – what their capabilities are, what their priorities are, what their mindsets and life conditions are and so on.
</p>
<p>India is a never-before world.  Never-Before in human history have we had so many young people with modest incomes and even more modest education, come of age post the birth of the internet and the mobile and digital money, combined with pathetic infrastructure and informal service sector jobs.  
</p>
<p>The logic of this world of Consumer India is to be listened to, from the inside , in order to serve it better, and build capabilities and products and ideas that can be valuable in other markets too.
</p>
<p>Sensible as all this seems, why do companies have trouble doing this?  Even champion global companies?
</p>

<h3>Human-Computer Interaction – the Life and Times, and the History</h3>

<p>HCI and Interact are here to stay. Many of us are born in a society where social media and smartphones are the common way of living. We take the opportunities for granted, and just develop ideas to broaden the use and to enable ever more innovative application, including cheap facilities for developing regions.
</p>
<p>We label our field: Human-Computer Interaction, Interaction Design, Usability Engineering – old words that could now be replaced by “Experience Design”. Or should they? We live in the clouds, our friends and family live on Facebook, and our watch is our coach and our physician. But how did this all start, and who were the pioneers to found the science and practice of Affordance Design, Cognitive Engineering and Software Ergonomics? Is it industry that started by inventing interactive systems, or the scientists who build theories and models for the user interface: What were the chickens that produced the egg of HCI? 
</p>
<p>In this talk you will learn about blue-grass movements in different parts of the world that did result in understanding, theories, prototypes, and approaches. The talk will illustrate how this was discussed and disseminated in communities and at conferences, how this evolved into education and standards, and how this resulted in recognition of our professional field as the base for design of usable, comprehensive, enjoyable, absorbing and un-evitable tools, culminating in a new context of life and society, and new cultures.
