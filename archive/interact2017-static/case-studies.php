                    <p>Case Studies are an excellent opportunity to showcase the design, development, evaluation and adoption (or not) of an interactive product or a service, whether the product or service was ultimately deemed successful or not. Case Studies should be reflective and concise, and should offer actionable original insights relevant to the practice of interactive product or service design.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>A Case Study could illustrate, explore, report, analyze, summarize, challenge, or simply describe. The specific focus of the Case Study may vary. A Case Study submission could highlight the design process, the teamâ€™s operational issues, or the specific product or service solution A Case Study could, for example, focus, on the and of the following topics:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A significant innovation through research or design (disruptive or otherwise)</li>
                            <li>Design of a specific experience, discussing its rationale, any issues, and lessons learned</li>
                            <li>Domain-specific topics in lesser known domains of interest</li>
                            <li>Pilot studies preceding and informing larger-scale investigation</li>
                            <li>Development, application, critique, or evolution of a method, process, theory, or tool</li>
                            <li>Management and strategy of research and design in a particular organization</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Case study submissions will not be constrained by traditional academic expectations, and do not require extensive literature review. Case Studies will be judged by their significant contribution to the field of interactive product or service design.</p>
                        <p>There are three keys to a successful Case Study. First, the Case Study should be based on real-world experiences. Second, the Case Study should be relevant to the conference focus and themes. Third, the Case Study should be detailed enough to be instructive for other members of the community, offering insights and clear lessons to inform their own practice.</p>
                        <p>Case study contributors could be interaction designers, information architects, usability experts, software developers, or other professionals from industry. We also welcome case studies from product developers, consultants/consultancies or funding agencies. Case studies could highlight collaborations and partnerships across different groups or between groups cooperating across geographical, political, or cultural boundaries.
