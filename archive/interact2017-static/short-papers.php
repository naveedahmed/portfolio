                        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
                        <section><p>Papers should be formatted according to <?php include( "springer-lncs-format.php"); ?>. Accepted short papers must be presented at the conference and will be published in Springer LNCS Series.
                                <p>Authors should guarantee the anonymity of their submissions. Please remove names and affiliations from the first page. Please avoid obvious identifying statements in the paper. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."
                                </p>
                                <p>Short papers may optionally be accompanied by a video not exceeding 90 MB in size. Video figures will be published online and may be used for publicity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
					Authors of accepted submissions must upload together with their final version of the paper, a <a href="files/IFIP_Springer_copyright_form_INTERACT2017.pdf" target="_blank">proceedings copyright form</a> for the inclusion of the paper in the proceedings and a <a href="files/media_consent_form_2017.pdf" target="_blank">media consent form</a> for allowing the potential taping and broadcasting of their presentation. </p>
