                    <p>Technical advances can make human activities easier, faster, more accurate and less costly. New advances can benefit people by helping them work more effectively and live more comfortably, for example, by creating new leisure activities and by opening new ways of communicating with friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
                    <p>The demonstration track is looking for examples of technical advances with such potential. We encourage demonstrations of new and emerging tools and technical solutions as well as innovations based on current solutions.</p>
