                <p>We take great pleasure to announce that there will be a Childcare Club at the conference during INTERACT 2017.</p>
			<h3>Childcare Club?</h3>
			<p>Yes. INTERACT 2017 will be having a Childcare Club during the conference where delegates can leave their kids in safe hands, so that they can attend the conference, without any worries. </p>
			
<h3>			So, how does it work?
</h3><p>The idea of having Childcare at the conference is more of a collaborative effort of parents and the conference team, rather than a service provided by the conference.</p> 
<p>Each day during sessions, one parent volunteer shall also pool-in to be with the team. We need a minimum of three parents showing interest to run the show.</p>
<p>And as it is a joint effort there shall be no fee, instead parents need to spend about 25% of their conference time with the Childcare Club; meaning effectively, there will be one parent per four kids at any time along with the professional care-takers.</p>

<h3>What age-group kids will be cared for?</h3>
<p>Care will be provided for children from age 6mth-12yrs. The Club will be open from September 27-29. However, as per delegate need, this can be extended to full 5 days of the conference, during Workshops and Field trips which start from September 25.</p>  
<p>Timings of club will be from 8:30am to 5:30pm.</p>

                    <figcaption>Activities like story-telling, crafts, arts, or outdoor activities will be available.</figcaption>

<h3>Where will the Club be located?</h3>
<p>The allotted Childcare space is located within the VMCC Convention Centre (the conference venue) on the Ground Floor. 
</p><p>The Club will have the following facilities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An air-conditioned space with attached bathroom</li>
    <li>A pantry</li>
    <li>First-aid facility</li>

    <li>Microwave</li>

</ul>
<p>There shall be play and other activities for older children (story-telling, crafts, arts or outdoor activities) which will be updated a few weeks prior to the conference, depending upon the response of parents.</p> 

<h3>How can I help?</h3>
