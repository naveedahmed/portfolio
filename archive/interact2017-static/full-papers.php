                            <p>Submissions of full papers are invited for publication in the conference proceedings. Papers may address any area of HCI, including those identified in the <a href="cfp#conf-topics">conference topics</a>. Submissions should report original work and must not have been published previously.

                            <p>All full paper submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel of experts. The review process will retain the anonymity of authors and reviewers. After review, authors of borderline papers may submit a rebuttal (the meta-review will clearly state where this is appropriate). INTERACT 2017 will include a shepherding process for papers which are conditionally accepted at the PC meeting.</p>

                            <h3>Guidelines</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>Papers should be formatted according to <?php include( "springer-lncs-format.php"); ?>. Accepted full papers must be presented at the conference and will be published in Springer LNCS Series.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Authors should guarantee the anonymity of their submissions. Please remove names and affiliations from the first page. Avoid obvious identifying statements in the paper. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Full papers may optionally be accompanied by a video not exceeding 100 MB in size. Video figures will be published online and may be used for publicity.
