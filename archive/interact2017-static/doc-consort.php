                            <p>The INTERACT 2017 Doctoral Consortium (DC) is a forum for PhD students to discuss their research goals, methods, and results at an early stage in their research. The Doctoral Consortium aims to provide useful guidance for completion of the doctoral research and the initiation of a research career in a friendly and constructive atmosphere.</p>
                            <p>The Doctoral Consortium will be held on September 25-26, 2017. The Consortium will be a closed event, open only to the selected participants and other invited attendees.</p>

                            <p>The Doctoral Consortium and INTERACT 2017 provides an opportunity for student participants to interact with other students, established researchers, and the broader HCI community. PhD students who are currently working in an HCI related field are eligible to apply.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Guidelines</h3>
                            <section><p>Doctoral Consortium candidates should have chosen a research focus and also have selected theoretical and methodological approaches and begun to conduct their research.</p>
                                <p>To benefit from the Consortium students should have at least 6-12 months of work remaining before the expected completion of their theses.</p>
                                <p>The number of participants in the Consortium will be limited. Selection for the Consortium will be based on the quality of the submission, its relevance to HCI, the relevance of the student’s contribution to the Consortium, and the potential benefit of the Consortium to the student’s research.</p>
                                <p>Students selected to attend the Doctoral Consortium will be asked to present their work to get feedback for future directions. Consortium attendees are free to submit a paper or contribution to any of the other tracks at INTERACT 2017 on content similar to that in the proposal for the Doctoral Consortium.</p>
