                            <p>We invite submissions of full papers for publication in the conference proceedings. Papers may address any area of HCI, including those identified in the conference topics. Submissions should report original work and must not have been published previously. </p>
                            <p>All full paper submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel of experts. The review process will retain the anonymity of authors and reviewers. After review, authors of borderline papers may submit a rebuttal (the meta-review will clearly state where this is appropriate). Interact 2017 will include a shepherding process for papers which are conditionally accepted at the PC meeting.
                            </p>

                                We invite you to pre-register your submission and upload an Abstract by 16 January 2017. This year references are no longer included in the page limit. Therefore authors are invited to submit full papers with a maximum of 18 pages, not including references, in PDF format by 25 January 2017 - 23:59 CET, using the conference submission system at ----. </p>
                            <p>Accepted full papers must be presented at the conference and will be published in Springer LNCS Series. Authors should guarantee the anonymity of their submissions (Your submission should have authors' names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."). </p>
                            <p>Full papers may optionally be accompanied by a video not exceeding 20 MB in size. Video figures will not be published.
