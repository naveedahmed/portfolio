                    <h3>Format</h3>
                    <p>The proposed format of the workshop should be innovative and interesting. Following are some examples of what may happen in workshops:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A traditional workshop with paper presentations, followed by forum discussions and a shared poster for presentation during the conference (please innovate this)</li>
                        <li>An interactive event, where participants work together on experimenting with or evaluating an artifact, and make a 360 degree video of the design or evaluation work highlights for presentation during the conference</li>
                        <li>A design workshop with focus on artefacts, with a gallery / showroom exhibition during the conference</li>
                        <li>Other, innovative formats of the workshop will also be of interest. Workshops should have a limited number of participants (up to 30). Workshops will take place on 25 and 26 September 2017, immediately preceding the main conference.</li>
                    </ul>
