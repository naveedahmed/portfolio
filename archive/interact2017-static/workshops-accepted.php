						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p>User activities and behaviours are “scripted” by the products they use. Therefore, designers intentionally or unintentionally end up shaping the user behaviour. </p>
						<p>Service design, which factors in longer span of user engagement has great potential to influ-ence user behaviour through the appropriately designed product-service systems. There is a need to influence and change user behaviours in their own interest to meet several social challenges, be it at the level of an individual (e.g. health and well-being) or society (e.g. global warming).
						</p>
						<p>Balancing the concerns of user freedom and privacy is critical too. Service Design and Design for Behaviour Change have significant con-gruence in terms of concern for value creation over long duration, dynamic usage contexts and accounting for diversity of users, among others. However, despite the affinity of these two fields, we do not come across works that demonstrate practice that blends both the fields or synthesised design knowledge base. Practitioners might be tacitly blending these two disciplines.
						</p>
						<p>This workshop aims to understand these practices currently, the challenges designers are facing and how they are addressing those. We hope to uncover this tacit knowledge, provide preliminary knowledge from the disciplines and synthesise through hands on work followed by collective reflec-tion.

						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p class="subtle"><strike>Purposeful games alternately called as serious or applied games are games with a purpose in addition to enter-tainment. The purpose of such games can range from providing learning, creating awareness, solving problems to changing behaviors. Increasingly, businesses, governments, NGOs and educational institutions are considering pur-poseful games to promote their commercial or social causes or facilitate academic learning.</STRIKE>
						</p>
						<p class="subtle"><strike>In this workshop, we focus on games in the citizen behavior space, such as, games that promote road safety awareness or environment-friendly living. We recognize that the major challenge with serious games is getting users to play them and sustain their interest in doing so. We therefore need to explore ways in which such games can be-come omnipresent and be played through novel interfaces, so that users interact with them in their daily routines. We also need to identify novel techniques for user motivation, going beyond the tricks of gamification.</STRIKE>
						</p>
<!--
						<p>The workshop will consist of practical concept building session, discussions, as well as theoretical talks by leading designers and researchers. We encourage workshop participants submit posters with ideas and concepts that push the boundaries of present day player interaction methods and motivation techniques.

						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p>Current multi-touch and motion sensing technologies allow for capturing a large scope of gestures and movements that can be used to interact expressively with various media. We would like to address in this workshop the problem of designing gestures in interactive systems, through practice and discussions. We argue that gesture design, which can be seen as being part of the interaction design, is generally overlooked. This practice-based workshop aims precisely at exploring various methodologies and tools to design gestures and body movements.
						</p>
						<p>The workshop is open to the participants of diverse backgrounds, including engineering, human and social sciences, design and performing arts. We will particularly encourage culture diversity and gender balance. Each participant will be asked to actively contribute to collaborative approaches for creating, sharing and evaluating various novel methods. In particular, we wish to focus the discussion on possible differences in cultures and contexts, and how this might affect both positively or adversely the appropriation of shared gestural interaction paradigms.
						</p>
						<p>The expected outcome of the workshop will be in the form of photos and video materials, disseminated on a website. Moreover, we ambition that this workshop will initiate a series of international events and collaborations with India.

						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p>Considerable attention has been paid for years to the relationships between humans and computers. But, over the years, the computer chip migrated from the computer internal organs to many other devices - to things, wearables, and even onto the skin (skinnables) and into the human body (implantables).
						</p>
						<p>This workshop will focus on how this revolution may affect the way we look at the relationships between humans and among humans, human elements and computing devices and what should be done to improve these interactions and ‘entanglements’ and to understand them better.
						</p>
						<p>In this workshop, we would like to provide a platform for discussions about the relationships among humans, technology embedded in the environment, and humans whose physical, physiological or/and mental capabilities are extended and/or modified by technology. Given these extended realities, the interface as we have known it and even the practical meaning of the word ‘interaction’ have changed.
						</p>
						<p>This workshop is intended to provide a platform for scholars, practitioners, and students to think together about how to frame the new interaction, engagement, and relationship between technology, humans, ‘modified’ humans and the new reality.

						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p class="
					">There are numerous research methodologies which designers resort to, in the Discovery/Research phase of design. In this phase, a UX designer acquires a plethora of insights from users, their surroundings, the stakeholders. But the million dollar question is how many of these insights get translated into actual designs? While the designer tries to assimilate these insights, there is no framework to define these insights into design goals, categorise them, prioritise them and use them as a guideline to render them into designs. </p>
						<p>This workshop will enable participants to learn this unique and interactive way of conducting research, gathering insights and converting them into metrics / attributes . These attributes can then be prioritized and used while designing or conducting usability testing. These attributes will not just help designers but will also serve as guidelines for BAs, developers, testers and whoever else that is involved in the project. The success of the project / interface can be easily evaluated using these desired attributes/metrics.
						</p>
						<p>In this workshop the participants will be actively involved in conducting the research, coming up with the attributes, prioritizing it, applying it in the design, testing the design and witnessing the usability impact</p>

					<div class="ft-abstract">
						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p> This workshop addresses the role of multimodality and mediated interaction for the analysis and design of human-centred, embodied, cognitive user experiences.
						</p>
						<p>The workshop focusses on multimodality studies aimed at the semantic interpretation of human behaviour, and the empirically-driven synthesis of embodied interactive experiences in real world settings. In focus are narrative media design, architecture & built environment design, product design, cognitive media studies (film, animation, VR, sound & music), and user interaction studies. In these and other design contexts, the workshop emphasises evidence-based multimodality studies from the viewpoints of visual (e.g., attention and recipient effects), visuo-locomotive (e.g., movement, wayfinding), and visuo-auditory (e.g., narrative media) cognitive experiences. Modalities being investigated include, but are not limited to:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>visual attention (by eye-tracking), gesture, speech, language, facial expressions, tactile interactions, olfaction
							</li>
							<li>human expert guided event segmentation (e.g. coming from behavioural or environmental psychologists, designers, annotators, crowd-sensing)</li>
							<li>deep analysis based on dialogic components, think-aloud protocols
							</li>
						</ol>
						<br>
						<p>The workshop brings together experts in Human-Computer Interaction, Spatial Cognition and Computation, Cognitive Science and Psychology, Neuroscience, Communications and Media, and Design Studies.
						</p>
						<p>Contributions addressing the workshop themes from formal, computational, cognitive, design, engineering, empirical, and philosophical perspectives are most welcome.

						<p> The workshop takes place at the INTERACT 2017 Conference in Mumbai.
						</p>
						<p>Consequently, there is a unique opportunity to observe technology-mediated innovative work practices in informal settings. In this context, away from the mainstream industrial sites of the global north, this workshop proposes to analyze findings related to opportunities for design research in this type of work domains.
						</p>
						<p>Outcomes include:
							<br/>a) human-centered design approaches for specific work domains (workplaces, smart workplaces); <br/> b) visions of new roles for workplaces that enhance both work practice and interaction design. </p>
						<p>In order to achieve this, participants will engage with conference-organized field trips, gather data and will discuss their experience at the HWID workshop on the following day.
						</p>
						<p>The ideal target audience is composed of researchers and practitioners working on any topic related to work analysis, international development, cross-cultural studies, interaction design. We will also look at the challenges of analysing work in informal settings as a way to inform the design of digital mediation.
						</p>
						<p>After the workshop, the dataset analysis can be structured in such a way it provides design implications. These two aspects - analysis and design - will form one (or more) manuscript submissions for a well-ranked journal (TBA).

						<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>						Asian HCI research is a one-day symposium, which we propose to bring together 10 leading researchers from Asia to come together to share their work and to discuss collaboration opportunities. A special session would be organized to explore and brainstorm about joint work and possibilities of collaboration. 
</p>
<p>There are several outstanding universities and industrial labs in Asia where HCI research takes place. Many universities from Asia are often involved in exchange of visits with universities in Europe and North America. Many students from Asia travel to do their masters and doctoral research in Europe and North America. Unfortunately, there has been relatively less research visits and student exchange within Asia. 
</p>
<p>One of the main difficulties for such people is to connect with like-minded people in order to start or augment their research interests. People wait for events to be organized in their countries to build network with people to take their research interest ahead. There are challenges in having access to laboratory set-up as well. 
</p>
<p>This symposium will help people connect with researchers for funding, research opportunities and collaborations. The symposium is likely to attract participants including current and prospective students, researchers and industry professionals.

<p>Whilst usability has been the most prominent user interface property in early HCI research other properties such as accessibility, inclusive design, user experience and, more recently security, trust and resilience might also affect the development of interactive system. 
</p>
<p>A good example is security which, by recommending users to deal with passwords reduces system usability by placing a burden on users. 
</p> 
<p>This workshop is open to everyone who is interested in multiple user interface properties while building their systems and how different these are valued by different stakeholders. We expect a high participation of the members of IFIP WG 13.2 and IFIP WG 13.5.

<p>We invite participants to present position papers describing real-life case studies that illustrate the tradeoffs between two or more user interface properties. Any property related to user interface design is welcome but two or more properties should be addressed in the same contribution. We are also interested in methods, theories and tools for managing multiple user interface properties. Position papers will be published in adjunct conference proceedings of INTERACT 2017. 
</p><p>During the workshop we also expect to discuss how to disseminate individual contributions to the community in the form of a special issue in a HCI journal.
