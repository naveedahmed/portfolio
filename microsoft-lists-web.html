    <h3>Microsoft Lists for web</h3>
    <p>
        Microsoft
        Lists is a smart information tracking app, that can be moulded into anything from a simple to do list to a
        complex inventory management system. The product has a tremendous usage and has existed within SharePoint in
        some form since 2001.
    </p>

    <p>My focus as the Lead Designer on the product was designing new list visualizations, building formatting
        features, and driving the product charter. I joined the team, when it was just set up in India and I, as a
        designer, was responsible to build credibility and be accountable to our global objectives. I started as an individual contributor on this product area, and later transitioned to the role of a Design Manager.
        
        <p>Today, our team
        drives several key areas that have a direct impact on the 190M
        SharePoint users.</p>

    <p class="bolt"><span class="bold">Related:</span> Read about me building <a
            href="microsoft-lists-mobile.html">Microsoft
            Lists for iOS and Android</a>.</p>

    <h3>Improving UX Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>When I joined the team, it was early days of modernizing the product, and we were finding avenues to make the
        product better. After listening to users and looking at feedback, I proposed that we should focus on improving
        the fundamental user experience. </p>
    <p>

        For example, the action to create a new column in a list was buried deep, and was missed by many users. I
        designed a simpler way and made it contextual, so that users can find it easily and complete the task quickly. I
        did a similar exercise with column
        reordering, where users could just drag columns and drop anywhere on the canvas.

    <div class="figcaption video-icon">
        <span class="bold">Video:</span> Improving fundamentals contributed to better engagement and retention
    </div>

    <p>These changes and upgraded experiences helped drive more engagement and contributed to the overall user retention
        in the product.
    </p>

    <h3>Low-code and no-code experiences</h3>
    <p>
        Lists had a vanilla way to display data. New JSON code-based features helped
        users to highlight content and find data easily, but this was rarely being used
        by novice users.

    </p>
    <p>I believed that making this feature easier to onboard will drive engagement. So, I built easy-to-use templates
        where, users could achieve with just a few clicks, what they did in JSON by writing several lines of code. This
        feature was loved by users. I made sure there was an interop between the templates and code, so that users
        can bootstrap on the WYSYWIG templates to write custom code.</p>

    <h3>Elevating Microsoft Lists</h3>
    <p>
        In 2021, we launched a brand-new avatar of SharePoint Lists as Microsoft Lists. The product now elevated in the Microsoft 365 suite and surfaced in the
        Office.com App launcher, creating a new funnel and a faster path to reach the product.
    </p>
    <p>We used benchmark studies and continuous engagement with our users to improve the fundamental
        experience of the product. I engaged the team in multiple review sessions to overhaul and polish the
        experience to meet the new bar we had set.

        <figcaption class="image-icon">The new Lists app in the Office.com App launcher and the new Lists Home.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>I worked with partner teams to create the new design framework, accessible colour palettes, and theming for the
        product. I spent a lot of time ensuring that the features I designed worked in various contexts and in
        first-party integration scenarios in Teams.</p>

        <img src="img_portfolio/ms/color_palette.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
    <p>As part of this, we introduced collaboration features similar to other Microsoft Office products. My major
        contribution here was to align various design stakeholders from different teams on the visual design and
        interaction
        of the feature. This ensured minimal dependencies and faster ship times.</p>

    <h3>New views and visualization</h3>
    <p>Lists is a horizontal product and serves a varied number of scenarios and verticals. For many users, views
        form an important part of their business workflows and collaboration. </p>

    <p>I have worked on creating many new and novel visualizations for list data over the years. One of the key problems
        I
        solved here was aligning the new UX with existing mental models of users. I have always had a high focus on
        craft
        and accessibility, and worked with Engineering to calibrate the processes to achieve this. </p>
       <h4>Gallery view</h4>
    <p> This was one of the earliest views I designed, and it was valuable
        collaborating with designers from Microsoft Excel, Bing, and SharePoint to understand different card frameworks
        and defining a new one for Lists. Beyond the view, the UX I made also has a card designer which gives users
        control to customize their cards.</p>

    </div>
    <!-- <div class="spacer-30"></div> -->
   <h4>Calendar view</h4>
    <p>One of my major features was the Calendar view for users with scenarios
        for event management and scheduling. I worked closely with the Outlook and Teams team to better
        understand user behaviour in a calendar and designed an experience that worked for List users. I reused many
        existing and familiar UX patterns from other Microsoft products, to help users onboard easily to the new
        experience.</p>

    <!-- <div class="spacer-30"></div> -->
   <h4>Board view</h4>
    <p> Board is the latest view, I designed, that caters to quick project and task
        management.
        One of my main challenges here was mapping the List mental model to a Board. The feature underwent multiple user
        testing cycles
        and I worked on simplifying the content copy to be closer to user expectations. I worked with PM & Engineering
        to come up with the
        MVP strategy, where we used user jobs as the criteria to prioritize features. </p>

    <h3>Learnings</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>Product development in enterprises can be a time-taking process, and it is necessary to ensure a high-quality bar
            when building for millions of users</li>
        <li>As a design owner, I am accountable for driving the cause of good UX and I could achieve this only through
            tight collaboration with partner teams </li>
        <li>Craftsmanship needs a methodical approach and as a Lead, I did the necessary tweaks in the product development process
            to ensure a high quality bar</li>
        <li>Telling right stories through prototypes or POCs is very important for buy-ins from the right stakeholders</li>

        <li>Building accessibility right could take more time than the feature itself. I learnt this while designing a11y and keyboard navigation for features in Lists. </li>
<!-- 
        <li>Having the Engineering team be part of the design process helps build more Enrolling the Engineering team on
            the 'why' of the UX helped build more trust and stronger commitment in the long
            run.</li>
        <li>As an IC on this product, one of my top priorities has been craftsmansip. I worked on process changes that
            helped ensure that we find and fix craft issues early on.</li> -->
